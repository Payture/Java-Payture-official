# Java-Payture-official
This is Offical Payture API for Java. We're try to make this as simple as possible for you! Explore tutorial and get started. Please note, you will need a Merchant account,  contact our support to get one. 
Here you can explore how to use our API functions!


## Payture API tutorial
Before fall into the deep, we're need to provide you general conception of working with our API function. See picture: 
![](paytureAPIJava.png)

## Steps

 * [Creating merchant account](#newMerchant)
 * [Get access to required API](#accessToAPI)
 * [Expand transaction](#expandTransaction)
 * [Send request](#sendRequest)

Now, let's walk through the steps from the picture above


## First Step - Creating Merchant Account <a id="newMerchant"></a>
To get access for API usage just create the instance of Merchant object, pass in the constructor the name of the host, name of your account and your account password.  Suppose that you have Merchant account with  name: Key = "MyMerchantAccount" and password Password = "MyPassword".

Pass the 'https://sandbox.payture.com' for test as the name of Host (first parameter).
```java
Merchant merchant = new Merchant("https://sandbox.payture.com", "MyMerchantAccount", "MyPassword");
```
We're completed the first step! Go next!
***
Please note, that  Key = "'MyMerchantAccount" and Password = "MyMerchantAccount"  - fake, [our support](http://payture.com/kontakty/) help you to get one!
***

## Second Step - Get access to required API <a id="accessToAPI"></a>
At this step you just call one of following methods on Merchant object (which provide proper API type for you) and pass in the PaytureCommands [see description here](#PaytureCommands): 
* Api (this is PaytureAPI)
```java
merchant.Api( PaytureCommands.Pay );
```
* InPay (this is PaytureInPay)
```java
merchant.InPay( PaytureCommands.Pay );
```
* EWallet (this is PaytureEWallet)
```java
merchant.EWallet( PaytureCommands.Init );
```
* Apple (this is PaytureApplePay)
And pass in the [PaytureCommands](#PaytureCommands).
```java
merchant.Apple( PaytureCommands.Pay );
```
Result of this methods is the instanse of Transaction object which you expand in the next step. 

 [See this table](#PaytureCommandsTable) for explore what PaytureCommands received  theese methods.

## Third Step - Expand transaction <a id="extpandTransaction"></a>
This is the most difficult step, but you can do it!
In the previous step we get the Transaction object [see here that is it](#Transaction). You need expand it, below you find detailed description how do this for every type of api.

At this step we're call only one method: ExpandTransaction(...). But there are more overload exist!
### expandTransaction ( String orderId, Integer amount )
This overload available in any of the API type

Call this for following PaytureCommands:
* Unblock
* Refund
* Charge
* GetState (PaytureAPI)
* PayStatus (PaytureEWallet, PaytureInPay)

| Parameter's name | Definition                                                        |

### ExpandTransaction Methods for PaytureAPI
#### expandTransaction( PayInfo info, HashMap<String, String> customFields, String customerKey, String paytureId  )
This overload you call for api **Pay** or **Block** methods ( PaytureCommands.Pay or PaytureCommands.Block respectively )
Description of provided params.

| Parameter's name | Definition                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| info             | Params for transaction processings [see here for explore PayInfo object](#PayInfo)     |
| customerKey      | Customer identifier in Payture AntiFraud system.                                       |
| customFields     | Addition fields for processing (especially for AntiFraud system).                      |
| paytureId        | Payments identifier in Payture AntiFraud system.                                       |


### ExpandTransaction Methods for PaytureInPay
#### expandTransaction( Data data )
This overload you call for api **Init** method ( PaytureCommands.Init )
Full description of recieved [data see here](#Data).
You must specify following fields of Data object then call Init api method of PaytureInPay:
* SessionType
* OrderId
* Amount
* IP
Other fields is optional.


### ExpandTransaction Methods for PaytureEWallet
#### expandTransaction( Customer customer, Card card, DATA data, boolean regCard ) 
This overload you call for api **Init**, **Pay** (on merchant side for registered or no registered cards);

#### expandTransaction( Customer data, Card card )
This overload you call for api **Add** method ( PaytureCommand.Add ) on merchant side.

#### expandTransaction( Customer data )
This overload is called for following api methods: **Register** (PaytureCommands.Register), **Update** (PaytureCommands.Update), **Delete** (PaytureCommands.Delete), **Check** (PaytureCommands.Check), **GetList** (PaytureCommands.GetList)
Description of recieved [Customer data see here](#Customer).

#### expandTransaction( Customer customer, String cardId, Integer amount, String orderId )
This overload is called for api methods: **SendCode** (PaytureCommands.SendCode), **Activate** (PaytureCommands.Activate), **Remove** (PaytureCommands.Remove)

### ExpandTransaction Methods for PaytureApplePay

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

## Last Step - Send request <a id="sendRequest"></a>
After transaction is expanded you can send request to the Payture server via one of two methods:
* ProcessOperation(); - this is sync method. The executed thread will be block while waiting response from the server - return the PaytureResponse object
* ProcessOperationAsync(); - this async method, return Task<PaytureResponse> object;


## Base Types:
* [PayInfo](#PayInfo)
* [Card](#Card)
* [Data](#Data)
* [DATA](#DATA)
* [PaytureCommands](#PaytureCommands)
* [Customer](#Customer)
* [PaytureResponse](#PaytureResponse)
